This website explains the basics of Manim Python Library. It is a powerful tool that can visualize concepts in mathematics and physics. Created by the 
YouTuber and educator Grant Sanderson, Manim has reinvigorated the thrist for mathematical learning for many people across the world. The website is 
not live due to monetary reasons. However, screenshots are provided.

My visualizations in this website are made for undergraduate physics laboratory experiments. 
The codes Bohr model, Momentum and Draw_Circle are written provided.

Python codes that are used for each scene are separated by a comment.

To run the first code, first you need to [install](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) Manim along with its multiple dependencies. Next, type the following in the terminal (without the ''):

'python code.py Draw_Circle -pqh'

Change the name to the scene you want to render.
