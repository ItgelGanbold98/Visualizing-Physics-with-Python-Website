# Visualizing_Physics_Code

Manim codes that are used as the example in the website for COMP30680 Assignment 1.

The codes Bohr model, Momentum and Draw_Circle are written by me, Itgel Ganbold (18407654).

Python codes that are used for each scene are separated by a comment.

To run the first code, type the following in the terminal without the '':

'python code.py Draw_Circle -pqh'

Change the name to the scene you want to render.
